I wonder how many people will think this is just a default page created by Jekyll and will never visit it? I kept it because it is a good place to start this journey. I realized that I suck at technical writing. I also realized I don't keep track of things that I work on both at work and privately. I want to change that and this is the very beginning of documenting things that keep me up at night.

How should I write this journal? The answer was simple, just use a site generator... that's what I thought. There are so many [static site generators][static-site-generators] that just selecting one made my head spin. Multitude of frameworks, written in different languages, run on different hosting providers. I had to narrow down the search and decided to gather some requirements to see which solution fits most of them.

- I don't care about the design. I want it to be clean, support images, graphs, and syntax highlighting. This is pretty much it.
- I want it to be IDE friendly, aka I wanted to write using markdown.
- I don't care about the language it is written in. As long as I can easily install it without starting a minikube or docker compose on my machine, it is good to go.
- I want hosting to be simple. I didn't want to create new accounts, no deployment setups, no domain needed and ideally hosted for free.

GitHub pages and Jekyll check all the boxes. It took me a little over an hour to set everything up, including writing this initial text. Exactly what I needed to get me started.
